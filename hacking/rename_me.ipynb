    "    - We can partition our code / functionality into two streams:\n",
    "    i) Finding whales / profitable wallets etc.\n",
    "    ii) Mapping these wallets to something. e.g. an alert when 1 (or more) of them purchase something. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of i) we already have written some `early_whales` functionality. For ii) we could use `intersect_dict` functionality. e.g. after identifying several wallets of interest (through whatever means) once per day we could run some code to compute the current intersection of their portfolios. How this might play out: we identify 20 wallets that are highly profitable. Some were early pepe whales, for example. Then, once per day, we run some code to compute the intersection of their portfolios. We notice that 8/20 have purchased a coin $\\theta$. Maybe $\\theta$ is a newly launched coin - this would be of particular interest! Maybe $\\theta$ is a \"trending\" token. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, we basically have the functionality to do this (once given the wallets of interest - which we already have a few of)."
